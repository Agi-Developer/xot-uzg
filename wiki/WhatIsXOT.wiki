= History =

XOT was born from a XBMC Script called Uitzendinggemist made by somebody called BaKMaN (http://xbox.readrss.com). It allowed playback of the Dutch public TV streams. It was however not kept up to date, so in december 2006 I decided to update the script to have it work again and called it Uitzendinggemist.v2

After some time I started extending the script with a larger history of episodes and eventually added more Dutch channels like RTL 4,5 & 7 and Talpa. As people were so enthusiastic about it more requests came for more channels. Because the original script was not made with the purpose of adding many more channels, I deciced to give the script an overhaul and to make adding a channel more straight forward.

The result is the XOT Framework: XBMC Online TV Framework. This framework can be used a couple of different ways:
  # Creating your own [ChannelScript channels] and adding them to my XOT-UZG script (the former Uitzendinggemist.v2). You will get stuck with my userinterface and my configuration. 
  # Create your own script by using the XOT and [XOTFramework customizing] the configuration and skins.
