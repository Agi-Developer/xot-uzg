_So, you want to use the XOT Framework for your own Online TV Script?_

This can be done and is not too difficult. This small tutorial will give an introduction into the XOT Framework. This WIKI page will contain the following items:
  # XOT Framework FolderLayout
  # XOT Framework Files
  # XOT Framework Configuration Files
  # XOT [ChannelLayout Channel Layout]
  # and finally the XOT [Skinning Skinning Layout]

The XOT Framework has a very specific folderlayout that should be be kept intact:

== Framwork Files ==
The main framework is based on a small number of files. These files are very dependent on eachoter and *should not be modified*:

|| *Filename* || *Description* ||
|| Default.py || Default python script that load all other modules and starts the logger and download handler||
|| Default.tbn || Button icon for XBMC. Just an renamed .PNG file (Can be changed)||
|| Readme.txt || Name says it all||
|| Logfile.(old.)log|| The two logfiles that are being kept. Logfile.log is the most recent one. Logfile.old.log the one from the previous runs||
|| chn_class.py|| Base class on which all channel scripts are bases. See [chn_class] page for more information||
