#summary Creating or Modifying a channel script

= Introduction =

A channel consists of a number of files in a folder. That folder must reside in the Channels folder of the XOT Script. This is an example of the layout:

{{{
+ Channels
  |    |
  |    + Channel1
  |    |    + chn_channel1.py
  |    |    + channel1icon.png
  |    |    + channel1largeicon.png
  |    |    + channel1background.png
  |    |    + channel1background16x9.png
}}}

*Please notice the channelname (Channel1) and the channelscript filename (chn_channel1.py)*. This is no coincidence! If the folder is named <Channel> the channelscript should be called chn_<Channel>.py!

The channel is completely managed from the chn_<channel>.py (from now on I will call it chn_name.py).
