#summary Installation of XOT Framework & Channels

= Installation =

== Requirements ==
XOT Uzg needs at least a R8683 build of XBMC and a version of the Python Image Library (PIL) on your XBox.

== Installing ==

The installation of the XOT Framework is very straightforward. Please follow these steps to make sure the installation done correct:

  # Backup your previous version of the XOT Framework
  # Delete all SubFolders in the XOT Framework Folder *except* the channels
  # Copy the new content in to the XOT Framework Folder

That is all and should do the trick

== Post Installation ==

Some channels need additional configuration. In the Uitzendinggemist XOT for instance, the Talpa channel needs an password/username. These can be changed in the the \channels\talpa\chn_talpa.py file. Look for this part in the top of the code
{{{
# ONLY EDIT THESE TWO VARIABLES !!!!!!! ##############################
PASSWORD='Password'
USERNAME='Username'
######################################################################
}}}
Here you must change the Password and Username for the Talpa/Tien channel.
