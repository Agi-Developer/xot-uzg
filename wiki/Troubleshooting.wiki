_Just a small not about XOT Uzg: it parses websites and websites can go down or change their layout! So before blaming the script, please make sure that the websites you are browsing with the script are online!_

Before mailing or posting issues with XOT Uzg please follow these steps FIRST:

  # Check if your Internet Connection is up and running (don't chase it :D );
  # Check if the website of the TV Channel you are trying to access is online;
  # Check if you can playback videos from within their own site;
  # Check XBMC for connectivity (did it get an IP adres and can you for instance do an imdb, cddb or weather lookup?
  # Did you delete all files of XOT Uzg before updating to a newer version? 

If these checks turn out OK, you can assume the problem is XOT Uzg. Please do the following:

  # Retrieve both the uzg.log and uzg.old.log file from the XOT Uzg folder on your XBox. See if there are some errors in there that could help you a bit further. 
  # If no errors are there, check the xbmc.log and/or xbmc.old.log for error related to XOT Uzg.
  # If the there are errors present and they are code related, please submit an Issue on this page and attach the logfiles to the post.
 
Furthermore, if an issue was introduced in a new version, please check the [Changelog] for any changes that could have lead to this issue.
